You're asking a **very important and subtle question**, and you're exactly right to challenge this:

> ‚ùì **If the message `m` is blinded and signed by FDS, and `m` could be *anything*, how can TGS know what the *expected* message `m` is?**
> Without this, **how can TGS verify that the client didn‚Äôt forge the fraud score?**

Let‚Äôs unpack this in full, and then show how real-world systems solve it.

## üîê Core Problem Recap

* The FDS uses **blind signatures**: it signs **without knowing the message `m`**.
* TGS receives the unblinded `m` and the signature.
* TGS can check that the signature is valid on `m`. But:

> ü§® **How does TGS know `m` encodes a valid fraud score? What stops the client from crafting a ‚Äúlow risk‚Äù score message and getting that blindly signed?**

---

## ‚úÖ Solution: FDS Determines or Commits to `m`, Not the Client

Even though FDS uses blind signatures, **the client doesn‚Äôt get to choose arbitrary `m`**. Here are the standard ways to enforce this:

---

### ‚úÖ Approach 1: FDS sends a **commitment to m** (e.g. hash)

**Flow:**

1. **FDS calculates:**

   $$
   m = \text{encode}(fraud\_score, challenge)
   $$

   Then sends `H = SHA256(m)` to the client.
2. Client must:

   * **reconstruct the exact `m`**
   * **blind `m`**, send it for signing
   * later **present (`m`, signature)** to TGS
3. TGS receives:

   * `m`, `sig`
   * also knows `H = SHA256(m)` from FDS (either passed through client or looked up)
4. TGS checks:

   * Signature is valid on `m`
   * `H == SHA256(m)` ‚úÖ

> üîê **This ensures the client didn‚Äôt choose `m` freely** ‚Äî it had to match a pre-committed value from FDS.

---

### ‚úÖ Approach 2: TGS knows `challenge` and reconstructs `m_expected`

If TGS and FDS **agree on how `m` is encoded**, then TGS can reconstruct what the message **should** be.

**Example:**

1. TGS gives the client a `challenge: abc123`
2. FDS computes:

   $$
   m = \text{SHA256}(‚Äúhigh‚Äù \| ‚Äúabc123‚Äù)
   $$

   and signs `blind(m)`
3. Later, the client sends:

   * `m`, `signature`
4. TGS knows:

   * The `challenge` was `"abc123"`
   * Expected fraud score was `"high"` (based on FDS logic or earlier info)
   * So it reconstructs `m_expected` the same way.

> üîÅ **If `m` ‚â† `m_expected`, the signature is rejected**, even if it's valid ‚Äî because TGS knows what message FDS *intended* to sign.

---

### ‚úÖ Approach 3: FDS signs **structured fields** (score + challenge)

Instead of hashing into a fixed `m`, `m` can be a binary-encoded message like:

```plaintext
m = {
  score: 2 bits,
  challenge: 256 bits,
  version: 8 bits,
  timestamp: 64 bits
}
```

* FDS sends the `challenge` and instructs the client to construct `m` in this way.
* TGS knows the format and expected values (`challenge`, `timestamp`, etc).
* It parses the submitted `m` to verify:

  * The fraud score is valid.
  * The challenge matches what it issued.
  * The timestamp is recent.
  * Signature matches `m`.

> ‚úÖ Again: **TGS is not guessing `m_expected`** ‚Äî it's deterministically reconstructing or parsing it based on protocol rules.

---

## üö´ What Happens If Client Chooses Their Own `m`?

If the client just chooses a `low` score and makes a valid-looking `m_fake`, here's what happens:

* TGS reconstructs `m_expected` (or already knows `SHA256(m_expected)`)
* It sees that `m_fake ‚â† m_expected`
* ‚ùå **Rejects the signature**, even if mathematically valid

So:

> üîí **Blind signing hides the message from FDS, but FDS *commits* to what the message must be.**
> üîé **TGS verifies that the revealed message matches that commitment.**
