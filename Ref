jGreat! If you‚Äôre diving into the technical foundation of how Apple‚Äôs Private Cloud Compute (PCC) implements blind signatures and fraud scoring in a privacy-preserving way, several **IETF RFCs** and drafts underpin the system. Below are the **relevant RFCs and standards** that explain the cryptographic and protocol-level techniques Apple is leveraging:

---

## üîê **1. RSA Blind Signatures**

### ‚úÖ **[RFC 9474 ‚Äî RSA Blind Signatures](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9474)**

* **Purpose**: Describes the blind signature scheme based on RSA, including blinding, signing, and unblinding algorithms.
* **Relevance**: PCC uses **RSA Blind Signatures** to allow signing of tokens (TGTs, OTTs, fraud data) without revealing the message to the signer (e.g. FDS).
* **Includes**: Security properties like **unlinkability**, **unforgeability**, and **blindness guarantees**.

---

## üßæ **2. Privacy Pass Protocol**

### ‚úÖ **[RFC 9578 ‚Äî Privacy Pass Architecture](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9578)**

* **Purpose**: Describes the general architecture for **anonymous authentication tokens**.
* **Relevance**: PCC‚Äôs flow is heavily based on **Privacy Pass**, especially the concept of issuing **unlinkable tokens** with rate-limiting and fraud scoring.
* **Covers**: Issuer-blinded tokens, redemption, metadata enforcement (e.g., rate limits, fraud score association).

### ‚úÖ **[RFC 9481 ‚Äî Privacy Pass HTTP API](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9481)**

* Standardizes the HTTP interfaces used for Privacy Pass token issuance and redemption ‚Äî useful if modeling client-server comms.

## üß™ **3. Draft: Privacy Pass with Fraud Detection**

While not yet standardized, Apple likely references this experimental work:

### üß™ **[draft-pauly-privacypass-device-attestation-01](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-pauly-privacypass-device-attestation-01)**

* **Authors include Apple employees** like Tommy Pauly.
* Adds device attestation and **fraud detection hooks** to Privacy Pass.
* Shows **how device-based fraud scoring can be integrated** while preserving privacy and unlinkability.

---

## üß† **4. Other Supporting RFCs & Concepts**

### ‚úÖ **[RFC 8017 ‚Äî PKCS #1: RSA Cryptography Standard](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8017)**

* Foundation for how RSA operations work, including **signing and verification**, and **padding schemes** (e.g., PKCS#1 v1.5, PSS).
* RSA Blind Signatures in RFC 9474 are based on this.
